- t2t uses an OhmJS grammar "as is"
- t2t supplies a grammar for a nano-DSL for rewriting

- step 1: use OhmJS grammar to parse input
- step 2: if the parse in step1 was successful then create the nano-DSL
  - step 2a: parse the rewrite grammar
  - step 2b: run the semantics for the nano-grammar - resulting in a blob of text that is a JS program (a namespace) that can operate on the CST generated by step 1s
